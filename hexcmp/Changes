I updated the program to use the new improved libhexfile.  The program is
now shorter and cleaner.  Released version 0.2.

I changed the name of the program from hexdiff to hexcmp.  A Google search
showed me there are a lot of programs out there named "hexdiff," and I just
don't want to get sued.

Instead of using bcmp to compare memory, I now check each byte individually
so I can output at which byte the hex files differ.  Downside: there are
more efficient implementations than byte-by-byte (such as that used in GNU
cmp).
