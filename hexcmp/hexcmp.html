 <h1 align="center">Hexcmp - Compare two hex files</h1>
 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>
  Hexcmp is a very simple program that tells you whether the memory
  represented in two hex files is equivalent.  In other words, even if
  two hex files are formatted differently, if they contain the same
  data, hexcmp will recognize that they are the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  The program will tell you the lowest memory address where the two files
  differ, and the contents of memory at that address for each file.  Note
  that this may not be the first sequential difference in either hex file,
  since it is perfectly valid to list records out of order in a hex file.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hexcmp compiles under Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.  It
  probably even works under Microsoft Windows, although I haven't had
  occasion to test it.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wrote the program because once I had needed a program like that, and
  couldn't find one.  When I wrote my <a href="dis51.html">dis51</a> 8051
  disassembly program, I had to write routines to parse a hex file.  I found
  it would be trivial to write hexcmp using those routines.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Compiling and using hexcmp</h2>
 <p>
  You can <a href="hexcmp-0.2.tar.gz">download the hexcmp source</a> for
  free.  It is released under the GNU Public License.  See <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">the GNU website</a> for more
  details.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, you will need to install libhexfile if you don't already have it. 
  Change to the libhexfile-0.0 directory, edit the Makefile as necessary,
  and run "make install" as root to install the library.
 </p>
 <p>
  To compile hexcmp, change to the hexcmp-0.2 directory, then edit the
  Makefile if necessary.  After editing the Makefile, type "make" and you're
  done.
 </p>
 <p>
  To run hexcmp, type "hexcmp file1.hex file2.hex".  You will probably
  want to put hexcmp in some bin directory for convenience.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you don't want to install libhexfile, you can try "make static" from
  the hexcmp directory.
